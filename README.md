## Running our Dashboard Locally

1. **Clone or download** our repository and set it as your working directory in your environment.

2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies to run our project by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r Frontend/Code/requirements.txt

3.Run our dashboard by executing the following command in your terminal:
python -m Frontend.Code.dashboard

After running, your terminal will display output like:
Dash is running on http://0.0.0.0:8080/
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080
* Running on http://192.168.X.X:8080

4. **To view the dashboard:**
   - Use `http://127.0.0.1:8080` if you're on the **same computer** (localhost).
   - Use `http://192.168.X.X:8080` if you want to access the dashboard from **another device on the same Wi-Fi** (e.g., phone, tablet, or another computer).
     - The `192.168.X.X` is the **local IP address** of the computer running the Dash app. It will automatically show up in your terminal after you run the app.
     - For example, if the terminal shows `Running on http://192.168.1.17:8080`, that's the address you can use from other devices on the same network.
